# c24.PizzaDiNoccatello

The KnockoutJS variation of the "Perfetto" research project.


## How to get started

Clone the repository, then load all node packages by executing the following command:

	npm install

Use the following commands to build/hint/minify/test etc:

	grunt              -- hint, test, minify, bundle amd modules, copy to dist (== creates the production version)
	grunt server       -- everything from the above tasks, then run development server and open browser with live reload
	grunt test         -- hint, then run tests (tests are not implemented yet)

Next TODOs: HTML transformation dev->dist.
